# STEM Knowledge - Web
A community driven pedagogical web resource for learning anything and everything in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

This project aims to create a complete and exhaustive web learning resource that not driven by SEO stuff. 
I was inspired by the website cp-algorithms.com which provides and awesome platform for learning competitive programming, with the best possible implementations. 

As of now, I'll start with Quantum Computing. Will aim to add more people to this project who can then carry it forward.
